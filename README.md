# Sextant – Network Dashboard (React)

**Sextant** is an interactive dashboard for monitoring network metrics in real-time. 
The project is designed to demonstrate **real-time data processing**, **metrics visualization**, and **preparing data for AI/ML analysis**.

## Project Goals
- Visualize IP addresses and latency metrics.
- Stream data in real-time using WebSocket.
- Prepare data for AI/ML analysis and network performance prediction.
- Showcase React frontend architecture for AI-driven analytics.

## Key Technologies
- **React.js** – frontend interface.
- **WebSocket** – real-time data streaming.
- **Data Visualization** – interactive components for network monitoring.
- AI/ML-ready data structures for predictive analytics.

## Future Directions
- Add a backend to collect and process network data.
- Integrate AI/ML algorithms for latency prediction and automated monitoring.
- Connect with cloud analytics platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).

## How to Use
